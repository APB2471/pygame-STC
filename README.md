SAVE THE CITY 

A simple and fun game created for a high school project to bring awareness to emergency preparation. 


GAME GUIDE

How to play:

The objective of this game is to keep the community alive for as long 
as possible by delivering resources to the residential area that are obtained 
from the warehouse.
The game takes place in the aftermath of a storm, and all resources are needed to survive.
Each resource is worth a number of points that increases as the game goes on.
The difficult of the game and the depletion of resources becomes greater as well.

If one of the resources reaches 0, you have failed and have the ability to restart.

How to control:

Control the FEMA worker with the arrow keys.

   Other keys include:

   p = starts the game
   q = quits the game

How to succeed:

Get the highest score possible.
TIP: Balance getting the resources that get the most points with the ones that are closest to being depleted.
